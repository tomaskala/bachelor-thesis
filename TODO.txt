first cluster the documents themselves by topic and detect events from those clusters
	- lots of documents make DBSCAN and other fancy algorithms unusable, but maybe KMeans would not be such a problem since we seek just a crude estimation, the events will be detected just fine
	- could use word2vec or doc2vec to reduce dimensionality, since:

event detection using word2vec or doc2vec models

finally, apply hierarchical clustering to the events themselves, will be fine since there are not a whole lot of them

extract headlines for the hierarchy levels ('topics') -- plain keywords / phrases? (Mikolov has phrase detection) and for events (real headlines of the documents, since they are all about the same event?)

if we do "document title is to document vector" as "??? is to event vector", we might get something nice?

when pre-clustering, use just the document titles as inputs?

if scatter-gather is used, do some visualisations using PCA into 2D/3D, add this to the thesis

also if scatter-gather is used, we could theoretically group the in-cluster documents by their publication days yet again to obtain events ?! (perhaps not that crudely, but a modification of the event detection algorithm could be used nevertheless)
