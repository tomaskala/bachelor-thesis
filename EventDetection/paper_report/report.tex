\title{Event Detection from the Reuters TRC2 Corpus}
\author{Tomáš Kala}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Dataset}
The dataset used is the Reuters TRC2 corpus \footnote{http://trec.nist.gov/data/reuters/reuters.html}. It comprises 1,800,370 news stories covering the period from January 1, 2008 to February 28, 2009. Each document consists of a headline, publication date, and the news story itself. On average, the document contain 8 words per headline and 203 words per body.


\section{Preprocessing}
As the documents consist only of plain text, some form of preprocessing is necessary before proceeding to event detection.

We first perform lemmatization and parts of speech tagging using the SpaCy package \cite{spacy}.

Next, we train the popular Word2Vec model \cite{word2vec} on the lemmatized texts. The implementation used comes from the Gensim library \cite{gensim}.

For the training, only punctuation symbols and words marked as unknown part of speech are discarded. The words were embedded into a 100-dimensional vector space using the skip-gram architecture, and allowing 5 passes over the collection with a 5-word window.

Having done that, we proceeded to the event detection. Here, we used only words marked as Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives and Adverbs. We also filtered out any word containing special characters. This left us with a vocabulary of size 180,114 unique words.


\section{Methods and parameters}

\subsection{Common settings}
The Dominant Power Spectrum boundary was set to 0.15, which left us with 1692 words considered for event detection. The window length for computing the moving average (Section 5.3.1 in the bachelor thesis) was set to 7.

\subsection{Original method}
No extra parameters.

\subsection{Embedded-greedy method}
No extra parameters.

\subsection{Cluster-based method}
Compared to the bachelor thesis where we used the DBSCAN algorithm \cite{dbscan}, its modification, HDBSCAN \cite{hdbscan}, proved to perform better on this dataset. After experimentation, parameters were set to $\epsilon = 1.0$, \textit{min\_samples} = 2, \textit{min\_cluster\_size} = 4.


\section{Results}
Results of the same evaluations as in the bachelor thesis are shown below. Compared to the Czech texts, more events with short period (7 days or lower) were detected. Such events are not usually as important as higher-periodic ones, as they usually concern sport matches, stock reports and so on. For this reason, all evaluations were done both on the detected events and on events with period higher than 7 days.

Also, similarly to the bachelor thesis, the cluster-based method shows tendency to generate one or two clusters filled by words that simply did not fit anywhere else. It is possible that this behavior is due to ill-set parameters, but even after playing around with those, this tendency remained. However, these clusters are easy to detect and removed, as they contain over 100 words, compared to real events consisting of at most a few tens of words. For this reason, these clusters (numbers 21 and 30 in the plots) were removed before evaluation. Neither of these two events remains after removing those with period lower or equal to 7 days.

\subsection{Detection statistics}
The results are very similar to those from the bachelor thesis. The original method generates a large number of events consisting of very few keywords. The embedded-greedy method detects fewer events with more keywords. The cluster-based method detects the lowest number of events with two outliers mentioned above.

\subsection{Detection statistics -- only events with period higher than 7 days}

\subsubsection{Number of events}

\bf Events detected & 113 & 18 & 14 \\ \bottomrule[1.25pt]

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Precision, recall, F-measure}

\subsubsection{As detected}
Overall, the cluster-based method reached the highest results. The high recall of the original method will be explained in Section \ref{redundancy}. The original method reached high redundancy, so that a correctly detected event would be counted multiple times.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r c c c} \toprule[1.5pt]
\bf Method & \bf Precision & \bf Recall & \bf F-measure \\ \midrule
\bf Original & 13.600\% & 26.316\% & 0.179 \\
\bf Embedded-greedy & 7.792\% & 18.421\% & 0.110 \\
\bf Cluster-based & 20.588\% & 26.316\% & 0.231 \\ \bottomrule[1.25pt]
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Only events with period higher than 7 days}
Compared to the previous table, the precision of all three methods is higher, while the recall remains the same. This confirms the intuition that there simply are not that many events of interest with a period as small as 7 days.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r c c c} \toprule[1.5pt]
\bf Method & \bf Precision & \bf Recall & \bf F-measure \\ \midrule
\bf Original & 14.159\% & 26.316\% & 0.184 \\
\bf Embedded-greedy & 11.111\% & 18.421\% & 0.139 \\
\bf Cluster-based & 35.714\% & 26.316\% & 0.303 \\ \bottomrule[1.25pt]
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\subsection{Noisiness}
\subsubsection{As detected}
The relatively high noisiness of the cluster-based method (where noisiness is expected to be low) is explained by the last 5 events detected. They all concern the same football matches, consist of words in different languages. They all have a low period though, and are filtered out in Subsection \ref{noisiness-high-period}.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r c} \toprule[1.5pt]
\bf Method & \bf Noisiness \\ \midrule
\bf Original & 80.800\% \\
\bf Embedded-greedy & 84.416 \\
\bf Cluster-based & 38.235 \\ \bottomrule[1.25pt]
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Only events with period higher than 7 days} \label{noisiness-high-period}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r c} \toprule[1.5pt]
\bf Method & \bf Noisiness \\ \midrule
\bf Original & 80.531\% \\
\bf Embedded-greedy & 88.889 \\
\bf Cluster-based & 21.429 \\ \bottomrule[1.25pt]
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Redundancy} \label{redundancy}
Redundancy was evaluated both on all events, and on those marked as ``not noisy''.

After removing noisy events, the embedded-greedy method seemingly performed very well. However, when we look back to the noisiness evaluation, we see that almost \textit{all} events were noisy. Therefore, not many events are left to evaluate redundancy after removing these.

\subsubsection{As detected}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r c c} \toprule[1.5pt]
\bf Method & \bf Redundancy (all events) & \bf Redundancy (no noise) \\ \midrule
\bf Original & 65.600\% & 33.333\% \\
\bf Embedded-greedy & 57.143\% & 8.333\% \\
\bf Cluster-based & 14.706\% & 19.048\% \\ \bottomrule[1.25pt]
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Only events with period higher than 7 days}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r c c} \toprule[1.5pt]
\bf Method & \bf Redundancy (all events) & \bf Redundancy (no noise) \\ \midrule
\bf Original & 67.257\% & 36.364\% \\
\bf Embedded-greedy & 22.222\% & 0.000\% \\
\bf Cluster-based & 0.000\% & 0.000\% \\ \bottomrule[1.25pt]
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Purity}
The cluster labels used for this evaluation can be found in Appendix \ref{cluster-labels}.

In this case, only events with period higher than 7 days were evaluated. The reason is that such short periods essentially cover the entire document stream with short bursts, and for each of those, the documents would need to be retrieved. As the Word Mover's Distance \cite{wmd} is by itself a computationally expensive operation, this would take an unbearable amount of time.

Furthermore, as we have seen when comparing results before and after removing these periods, such short-periodic events do not really contribute anything meaningful.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r c} \toprule[1.5pt]
\bf Method & Purity \\ \midrule
\bf Original & 33.62\% \\
\bf Embedded-greedy & 27.51\% \\
\bf Cluster-based & 60.59\% \\ \bottomrule[1.25pt]
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\subsection{Computation time}
The Word2Vec model can be pretrained and stored for future use. The tightest bottleneck of our two methods is therefore the Document retrieval phase.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r c c c} \toprule[1.5pt]
\bf Unit & \bf Original & \bf Embedded-greedy & \bf Cluster-based \\ \midrule
Word2Vec training & N/A & \multicolumn{2}{c}{2h 10min} \\
Bag of words & $\longleftarrow$ & {15min} & $\longrightarrow$ \\
Word trajectories & $\longleftarrow$ & 7s & $\longrightarrow$ \\
Event detection & 5min 56s & 5min 49s & 2min35s \\
Document retrieval & 1min 44s & 4h 41min & 4h 16min \\ \midrule
\bf Total & 22min 47s & 7h 12min & 6h 44min \\ \bottomrule[1.25pt]
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
